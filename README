Use value iteration to discover a longest path in a given graph.

The longest path problem is described by a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Each
state in the MDP is a path originating from the given source vertex. The other
endpoint of the path can be any vertex, including the target. If this endpoint
is the target, then the state has no available actions. Otherwise, the state
can be acted on by drawing an edge to one of the endpoint's neighbors not
already in the path. If the action draws an edge to the target, then the reward
is the length of the new path, otherwise it is zero. Given an initial state of
just the source vertex, the goal is to find the actions that can maximize the
return (in this case, the final reward).

Depends on networkx and matplotlib.
